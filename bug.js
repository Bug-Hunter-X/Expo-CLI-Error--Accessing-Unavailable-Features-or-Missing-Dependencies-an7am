This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or API that's not available in the Expo Go app or the environment you are running your Expo project in.  For example, trying to use device-specific features (like camera access) inside Expo Go before enabling them in your app.config.js or app.json may trigger this error. Another potential cause is attempting to import modules or libraries not properly installed or supported within your current Expo setup.   Incorrectly configured environment variables or missing dependencies also contribute.
