The solution depends on the root cause of the error.  Here's how to approach common scenarios:

**1. Missing Dependencies:**
   - Carefully review your `package.json` to ensure all necessary modules are listed. Use `expo install [package_name]` to install missing packages. 

**2. Unavailable Features (in Expo Go):**
   - Ensure you have enabled the required features (like camera, location) in your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.  Refer to the Expo documentation for detailed instructions on enabling specific features.  If you're using a feature requiring native modules, understand that the functionality might be limited or unavailable in Expo Go (consider using the standalone app). 

**3. Incorrect Environment Variables:** 
   - Double-check your environment variables to ensure they are set correctly.  Consult the documentation for any third-party libraries or APIs you are using to determine how environment variables are utilized within your project.

**4. Permissions (for accessing device features):** 
   - If the error occurs because of restricted access to device functionality (such as camera access), ensure that appropriate permissions are requested and granted in your app. Consult the Expo documentation on how to obtain necessary permissions. 

**Example (bug.js):**
```javascript
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions'; // Missing or incorrect import
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'; // Might not be available in Expo Go

// ... code that uses Camera ...
```

**Example Solution (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

export default function App() {
  // Add permission check
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);
  
  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; 
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }

  // ... code that uses Camera (only runs if permission is granted) ...
}
```
